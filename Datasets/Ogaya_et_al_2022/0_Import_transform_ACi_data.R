## This codes is used to do the step 0 of the data curation process.
## It imports and transforms the ACi data from Ogaya et al 2022.
## The dataset is available publicly : https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-5-2022


# Load the 'here' package to easily reference files and folders path, which is robust and independent on your platform (Linux, Windows..)
library(here)

# Find the path of the top relative directory

# Loading the ESS standard column names that will be used for all datasets

# Select specific columns from the original data to create the curated data set
# Here I selected several times the column SampleID. This is because the Record and gsw columns were missing (column 2 and 7, respectively).
# I then rename this columns and populate them.

# Rename the columns of the curated dataset with the ESS standard
# I also kept the column "Remove" which is not part of the standard and that will be usefull to analyse the
# data quality. It corresponds to the author flagging of bad data. THis column doesnt have to be included
# in other datasets.
