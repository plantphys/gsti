Photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO2) response curves and hyperspectral reflectance were measured in sun-exposed leaves from six tree species, including five overstory species (Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, Sacoglottis trichogyna, Goethalsia meiantha, Virola sebifera) and one understory species (Warszewiczia coccinea). Most leaves were light adapted but the dataset includes some dark adapted leaves. 20-50cm branches were detached from the main tree and recut underwater to avoid xylem cavitation and maintain the water column intact. We selected a healthy and mature leaf from each branch to run the CO2 response curve. CO2 response curves were performed for each leaf using the LI-6800 portable photosynthesis system (LICOR, Lincoln, NE, USA). For each CO2 response curve, CO2 concentration varied from 50 to 1400 μmol/mol with a reference CO2 of 420 μmol/mol. Leaves were inducted with 1000 or 1500 μmol/mol irradiances, 30° C temperature, and 65 % relative humidity. Observations were initiated when carbon assimilation rate (A) was stable, with values no less than 5 μmol/mol and stomatal conductance values greater than or equal to 0.06 mol H2O m-2 s-1, preferably. After performing the CO2 response curves for each leaf, we measured leaf reflectance using a hyperspectral spectroradiometer (SVC, HR-1024i, Spectra Vista Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA) equipped with a leaf clip LC-RP-PRO. The specifications on this spectroradiometer were a 25° FOV optic fiber with an autointegration time of over 3-5 seconds to maximize signal. We run R package pavo obtaining 1 nanometer (nm) resolution reflectance between 350 and 2500 nm. A white reference panel attached to the leaf clip was used before each reflectance measurement. We conducted three spectral measurements per leaf and the values reported here correspond to leaf averages. Spectral measurements were performed on intact tissue on the adaxial part of the leaves.
