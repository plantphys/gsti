## It is used to import Rdark data and transform it in a standard format

# Load the 'here' package to easily reference files and folders path, which is robust and independent on your platform (Linux, Windows..)
library(here)

# Find the path of the top relative directory
path=here()

# Set the working directory to the 'Kyaw_et_al_2024' folder where the data is located
setwd(file.path(path,'/Datasets/Kyaw_et_al_2024'))

# Importing the author's Rdark data
Rdark=read.csv("Leaf respiration.csv")

# Checking data quality
hist(Rdark$Rdark) # No negative values
hist(Rdark$Tleaf_Rdark)


# Saving Rdark data
save(Rdark,file="Rdark_data.Rdata")
