PLSR models were trained on 90% of data pooled from Experiments 1, 2, and 3 (black bars) or Experiments 1 and 2 (grey bars) or from individual experiments (Experiment 1 [vertical striped bars], Experiment 2 [white bars], or Experiment 3 [dotted bars]) and validated on the test dataset (remaining 10%).
